    <h1> 2 Unveiling Water Quality Patterns </h1>
    <h2> Enterococcus Counts and Rainfall Correlations in Boston Streams </h2>
    <p id="column_width"> This website is dedicated to visualizing the <b>compelling connection between low rainfall and elevated enterococcus levels</b> in Boston's stream water. This visualization focuses on two critical sampling stations along the Charles Riverâ€”one at the river's source and another at the basin. Through this interactive graphs users can explore the fluctuating trends in enterococcus counts in response to varying rainfall levels at these specific locations. Our goal is to provide a clear, user-friendly platform for researchers, environmentalists, and the general public to comprehend the impact of precipitation on water quality in different segments of the Charles River. This visualization study serves as a valuable resource for understanding the environmental dynamics at play and fostering informed decision-making regarding water management practices in the Boston area.</p>
